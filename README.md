# Mini_Project
ANKYRIN REPEAT DOMAIN USING MECHINE LEARNING APPROACHES

The aim of this project is to construct a machine learning (ML) model with the capability to provide precise predictions regarding the presence or absence of ankyrin repeat domains within protein sequences. 
This model will be further expanded to predict the number of such repeats and identify potential interacting partners.
